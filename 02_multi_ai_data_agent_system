Workstream 2: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

Objective:
To architect and simulate a virtual data management team composed of multiple, collaborative AI agents, designed to handle complex, end-to-end governance workflows and explore the feasibility of a semi-autonomous data management function.

Core Concept:
This workstream tackles a more visionary challenge: moving from single AI agents to an integrated, collaborative system. It explores whether a team of specialised AI agents can work together to manage a complex data process. This research is crucial for understanding the future organisational structure of data teams and the evolving role of the AI-enabled data professional as an orchestrator rather than a mere doer.

Key Research Questions:

System Architecture & Collaboration
- What is the most effective collaboration framework for a multi-agent data team? 
- Should it be hierarchical (e.g., a "Manager" agent delegating to specialists) or a decentralized, consensus-based "swarm"?
- How do agents effectively pass complex context and artifacts between each other without information loss?
- What are the most effective protocols for agents to resolve conflicts or handle interdependent tasks?

Governance & Accountability
- How can we design an auditable and transparent decision-making process within a multi-agent system?
- What are the primary failure modes for a collaborative AI system in a data management context, and what are the strategies for mitigation and human oversight?
- Who is accountable when an autonomous system makes a governance error? 
- How do we embed ethical guardrails and clear accountability frameworks into the system's design?

Organizational Impact
- Does the existence of a MAS truly empower a single human data manager to manage an entire function, or does it create new, unforeseen complexities?
- What new skills are required for a human to effectively manage, orchestrate, and troubleshoot a multi-agent system?

Expected Outcomes:
- A detailed architectural blueprint for a multi-agent data management system.
- A simulated proof-of-concept demonstrating the system's ability to execute a complex workflow.
- A whitepaper on the opportunities, risks, and organizational implications of deploying multi-agent systems for data governance.
