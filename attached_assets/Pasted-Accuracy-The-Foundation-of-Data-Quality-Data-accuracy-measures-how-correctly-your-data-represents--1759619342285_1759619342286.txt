Accuracy: The Foundation of Data Quality
Data accuracy measures how correctly your data represents real-world entities or events. In Six Sigma terms, we’re looking at the deviation between recorded values and actual values.

Example: A healthcare provider discovered their patient medication records had a 2.3% error rate – potentially dangerous in medical settings. By implementing automated validation systems and double-entry protocols, they reduced this to 0.01%.

Completeness: Ensuring No Critical Data is Missing
Data completeness refers to having all required data present and usable. Develop a comprehensive framework for measuring and improving data completeness.

Example: A telecommunications client was struggling with customer churn analysis because 30% of their customer profile data was incomplete. They implemented mandatory field requirements and automated data collection, improving completeness to 98% and reducing churn by 23%.

Consistency: Maintaining Uniformity Across Systems
Data consistency ensures uniform representation of information across all systems and processes. Consistency is what turns data into a universal language for your organization.

Example: A global retail chain found their customer addresses were formatted differently across their CRM, shipping, and billing systems. By implementing standardized formatting rules, they reduced shipping errors by 42% and saved $2.3 million annually.

Timeliness: Ensuring Data Availability When Needed
Timeliness measures how current your data is and whether it’s available when needed for decision-making.

Example: A semiconductor manufacturer was making pricing decisions based on market data that was 48 hours old. By implementing near-real-time data updates, they improved pricing accuracy by 28% and increased margins by 12%.

Validity: Ensuring Data Meets Business Rules
Data validity measures how well data conforms to its required format, type, and range rules.

Example: A major insurance company found 13% of policy numbers didn’t match the required format, causing claim processing delays. Implementing automated validation rules reduced this to 0.3%, saving 2,800 processing hours monthly.

Uniqueness: Eliminating Costly Duplicates
Data uniqueness ensures that each real-world entity is represented exactly once in your dataset. Every duplicate record is a potential point of failure in your decision-making process.

Example: A retailer discovered that 12% of their customer records were duplicates, leading to redundant marketing efforts and customer frustration. By implementing robust deduplication protocols and unique identifier systems, they reduced duplicate records to 0.1% and improved customer satisfaction scores by 34%.

Integrity: Ensuring Data Relationships Remain Intact
Data integrity ensures that relationships between different data elements remain accurate and maintained throughout the data lifecycle. Think of data integrity as the trust factor in your data relationships.

Example: A business solutions provider discovered that 7% of their customer orders weren’t properly linked to inventory records, causing fulfillment delays. By implementing referential integrity constraints and relationship validation rules, they improved order processing efficiency by 34%.

Reliability: Building Trust in Your Data
Data reliability measures how consistently your data produces expected results and maintains its quality over time. It’s what I call the “sleep well at night” factor for data-driven decisions.

Example: At a financial institution, inconsistent reporting data was causing board-level trust issues. By implementing reliability metrics and continuous monitoring, they achieved 99.97% reliability in critical financial reports, restoring stakeholder confidence.
