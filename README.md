The first open-source AI Agent and Tool R&D project for the data management discipline

## AI Agents for Data Management: A Manifesto for Convergence

The objective is simple: 

`To mature the data management community through the innovative application of AI agents`

Without meaning to appear drawn-in by the hype of AI Agents, which is present everywhere across boardrooms, offices, social media and the news, the reality is that there’s a lot of work to be done on modernising the Data Management discipline and AI agents could just hold the answer. Data management is being rightly criticised for its slow, often bureaucratic, approach to delivering value. While AI is already transforming analytics and data science, e.g., being used for data analysis, creating synthetic data, extracting and writing data to databases, and even doing data science. So too should we consider what exactly could AI and, more specifically AI agents hold for the discipline?

Data management, championed by the global DAMA community, is the backbone of any modern organization. It is the foundation of AI and the bedrock of ensuring data is fit for decision-making. Yet, for too long, its practitioners have been caught between extremes, creating a legacy of failed initiatives. I see three Traps of Data Management:

- The Academic Trap: This approach creates a Data Management Office that acts like an abandoned library - a repository of dusty, theoretical documents that the business has no interest in reading. Its practitioners alienate colleagues with rigid demands and abstract language, creating a chasm between governance and operations.
- The Careless Trap: Here, the importance of strategy is undermined. Projects are launched without any consideration for the data that underpins them, leading to inevitable failure and reinforcing the business's skepticism.
- The Technophile Trap: This reduces data management to a sales pitch for technology. Professionals act as vendor salespeople, where everything is about platforms and tools, and the business is merely a passive user to be consulted on UI design.
  
I and others have witnessed these traps over and over again, and we believe these failures usually stem from a fundamental inability to connect three critical components: Theory, Context, and Execution.

## Theory, Context and Execution: Bridging the Divide with AI

The path forward requires a new model that explicitly links these three elements. AI agents could be bridge that can finally unify them:
- Theory (The 'What'): We have practitioners who understand the theoretical requirements of regulations like GDPR or PDPL. They know policies and standards must be created. However, they often lack the skills to ground this theory in the business, resulting in irrelevant, shelf-ware documentation.
- Context (The 'Where'): Others are adept at gathering business context. They can sit with managers, identify key risks, and understand operational realities. But they often lack the ability to translate this understanding into practical, technology-enabled execution.
- Execution (The 'How'): The rarest professional is the one who can master all three — the ultimate Data Professoinal. Even then, the process is often slow, and time is a luxury the business rarely affords.
  
So some core questions, among others, for this project aims to answer, include:

- How can AI agents accelerate the convergence of Theory, Context, and Execution in data management practice?
- How can AI agents support regulaory and international best practice adoption?
- What kind of tools do the data management community need to develop to support their work?

## Our Four Strategic Workstreams

This initiative is structured across four key workstreams, each designed to build practical tools and frameworks for the data management community:

- Single-Agent Systems: Building specialized AI agents for core data management functions (e.g., a Data Quality Analyst agent, a Data Modeler agent) designed to automate and augment the work of human specialists.
- Multi-Agent Systems: Architecting entire virtual data management teams. Can a multi-agent system, composed of specialized agents, take on the full scope of a traditional DMO or data governance function?
- Regulatory & Compliance Agents: Training AI agents on international best practices (DMBoK, ISO) and specific data regulations to provide real-time, context-aware guidance and support for organizations.
- Community Tooling & Infrastructure: Creating and archiving open-source data management tools (e.g., an API for a data classification tool) that can be ingested and leveraged by other AI agents, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.
  
The DAMA community is modernising and we're waiting for a much needed DMBoK version 3 in 2026 and, as data professionals, we have a responsibility to not just participate in supporting that work, but also to actively shape the tools and approaches our industry are using. This project is my contribution to that effort - to become AI-enable data professionals.
