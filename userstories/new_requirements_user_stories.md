# AI4DM New Requirements: User Stories

## Analysis Summary

After reviewing the current AI4DM implementation against the philosophy guidelines, I've identified key gaps between the theoretical vision and the practical implementation. The current frontend provides basic chat and file management capabilities but lacks the sophisticated data management tools, regulatory knowledge systems, and multi-agent coordination described in the AI4DM philosophy.

**Key Gaps Identified:**
1. Missing specialized data management agents and tools
2. No regulatory knowledge base or compliance checking
3. Lack of workstream-specific functionality beyond basic interface
4. No multi-agent system coordination
5. Missing data quality assessment and governance capabilities
6. No business-context integration features
